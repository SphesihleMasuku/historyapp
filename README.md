HISTORY APPLICATION 

 

 The name of my app is History app. The purpose of my app is for a user to enter in a integer whole number then the app matches the person's age with the age of someone who died at the specific age. 

ANDROID STUDIO  

This tool was used to code, design , test and run the app. 

(PALETTE) 

•2 Text Views; 2 Buttons; and 1 Edit Text were used on the User Interface.  

•EDIT TEXT allows the user to input integer numbers that are within the range of 20 and 100 . Android : Background used to add a texture of light grey  = “#36262B2C"  to the background of the EDIT TEXT ; android:hint “Please enter your age" this gave  the user a hint on what to input but this hint would disappear if an input was entered; android: text color “@color/Brown “ made the text a light shade of brown.  

 

•TEXT VIEW 1 displayed the output such as the information regarding the historical figure that matched the user's age ,shows an error handling message if the user enters any input that is not a integer whole number . Android: background used to add a texture of light grey “#36262B2C" ; android:text Alignment = “center" center's the Within the text view ; android: text color =@color/Brown “Change the text into a lighter shade of brown ; android : text size= “20 dp" Increase the size of the text 

 

•TEXT VIEW 2 Is used as a heading for the name of the history app . android: background = “#4426B2C" Is used to make the hitting visible by using a lighter shade of grey in the background ; android: text alignment = “ center" Align the heading in the middle of the screen ; android: text all caps =”true “ made all the text in capital letters ; android:text = “@color/Brown “ made the text color a lighter shade of brown ; android:text size = “Increases the font size will be larger ; android: text style = “bold" makes the text bold 

 

•SUBMIT BUTTON .Takes the input from the user didn’t matches with the age of the historical figure. editing a file called themes allowed me to change the color of the Button. Android : background =”@color/brown" Was used to make the pattern light brown 

 

•CLEAR BUTTON Close the information on the text view and input on the edit text which allows the user to input the next stage and for the results to be displayed on the text view once the user’s age is matched with the historical figures age of death  

 

(MAIN ACTIVITY ) 

•Made use of {Private lateinit var} to declare the :Button,Text view and edit text . To initialize the above a findViewById(R.id. ) was used . Enabled the SetOnClickListerner which made the search button work if it were clicked .Within the curly brackets o the Submit button [val age = ageInput.text.toString().toIntOrNull()] creates a variable of age that gets the value from the user . A code is also used in order to set the range from 20 t 100 for the age values that are permitted to be entered . The information that is displayed on the text View about the historical figures is stored in the MAIN ACTIVITY. There are ten  different historical figures who are from all aver the world .  

 

>Error handling is implemented in the main activity in the case that the user enters a age that is below the range of 20 and above 100 ; if the user input a number such as 20.3 or enter the number in alphabetic such as ten. IN the case that the above is enters an age that is within the range but there is no  historical figure that died at that age the text view will display “No historical figure found with age entered if the input is not within the range the text view will display “Invalid input . Please enter valid age between 20 and 100”  

 

    

(COLORS) 

•.Alow me to store  my custom color within the color XML file which, was used on the text view it is and the button 

 

(DEVICE MANAGER) 

•.A virtual phone which runs my application which is the history app allows me to test on whether the code written works ,enables me to find errors which may show up if it is used by an end user the device used for my app was pixel two EPI 34 

 

(EMULATOR) 

•The emulator translates my high-level cuddling language into low level computer code which is binary ones and zeros
